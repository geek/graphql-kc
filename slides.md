1. Introduction
2. Schema/Query
3. Server
4. Mutation
5. Client
6. Testing
7. Summary


## Introduction

- Type system for describing data and API
- Query language for interacting with APIs
- Provides extra benefits:
  - Batched requests
  - Req/res validation
  - Usage tracking
  - Responses only contain data client requests

## Specification / Libraries

- Facebook project started in 2012 -
- Open spec, free to use, no copyright worries
- GraphQL JS library for execution engine
- https://github.com/facebook/graphql/

## Schema

```
type User {
  id: ID!           // ! = required
  email: String!
  firstname: String
  lastname: String
}

type Query {
  getUser(email: String!): User
}
```

## Query

```
query {
  getUser(email: "test@test.com") {
    firstname
    lastname
  }
}
```
* note: no commas or semicolons


## Demo of schema/query


## Server Responsibilities

- Load and processing of schema
- Must be able to execute queries

## Server libraries

- hapi - Node.js framework for web apps
- graphi - GraphQL plugin for hapi
- [show usage in server1.js]

## Schema Enum

```
type Address {
  lineone: String!
  linetwo: String
  city: String!
  state: StateCode
  zipcode: String
}

enum StateCode {
  MO
  KS
}
```

## Sub query example

```
query {
  getUser(email: "test@test.com") {
    email
    firstname
    lastname
    address { lineone }
  }
}
```
[server2.js]

## Batch query example

```
query {
  user1: getUser(email: "test1@test.com") {
    address {
      lineone
    }
  }
  user2: getUser(email: "test1@test.com") {
    address {
      lineone
    }
  }
}
```

## Variables example

```
query getUser($email1: String!, $email2: String!) {
  user1: getUser(email: $email1) {
    email
    firstname
    lastname
  }
  user2: getUser(email: $email2) {
    email
    firstname
    lastname
  }
}
```

## Handlers as resolvers

- Help migrate from REST
- Access the full request object
- Utilize hapi auth at a per handler/resolver

[server3.js]

## Mutations

- Same as a query from clients perspective
- Specified as a different type: `Mutation`
- Begin to use `Input` type


## Mutation Schema

```
input UserInput {
  email: String!
  firstname: String!
  lastname: String!
}

type Mutation {
  createUser(user: UserInput!): User
}
```


## Mutation Request [server4.js]

```
mutation {
  createUser(user: {
    email: "test@test.com"
    firstname: "Foo"
    lastname: "Bar"
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

## Client Requests

- No extra libraries required
- Can ask for only data that is needed
- See example under client/store

## Testing

- test handlers like in REST
- validate schemas with graphql parse
- test queries with easygraphql-tester [see test/]


## Summary

- GraphQL is a powerful addition to your toolset
- Useful when multiple client teams with varying constraints
- Mature ecosystem that is easy to get started with
